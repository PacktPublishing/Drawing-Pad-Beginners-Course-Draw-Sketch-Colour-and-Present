## About the Video Course
If you don't already know, using a drawing pad with free or inexpensive drawing programs will make you look like a "guru" in anything you do. I've personally only seen the top gurus in online marketing have a setup like I'm about to show you. Not only will your drawings and writings look A lot better/smoother/crisper, but you'll also be able to create unique content on-the-fly with what I show you inside.Note: This is not an artistic class. This is geared towards business. Training is for the drawing program, Leonardo.
